## üõ†Ô∏è Config Changes & Upgrade Notes

### Config Versioning
The `watchdog_config.yaml` file now includes a `version` field. When upgrading RadMac, always check the config version and the changelog below. If your config is missing new keys or structure, review the latest `watchdog_config.yaml.example` and update your config as needed.

**Upgrade best practices:**
- Never overwrite your existing `watchdog_config.yaml` during upgrades or deployments.
- Always mount your own config as a volume (see `docker-compose.yml`).
- Review the config change log and update your config if new keys or structure are introduced.

### Config Change Log
- **v1.2.1 (2025-09-02):**
	- Added direct `health_url` for db and radius services
	- Added `version` field and config change log
	- Changed `default_interval` key for clarity

üõ°Ô∏è RadMac ‚Äî Web Manager and radius server for MAC-based authentication / VLAN Assignment

## ü©∫ Health Endpoints & Watchdog Configuration

### Health Endpoints

RadMac exposes `/health` endpoints for all core services:

- **App**: `/health` (aggregates app, db, and radius status)
- **Database**: `/health` (directly on the db container, port 8080)
- **Radius**: `/health` (directly on the radius container, port 8080)

You can test the app's health endpoint (aggregated) with:

```sh
curl -i http://localhost:8080/health
```

Or test the direct endpoints (from the host):

```sh
curl -i http://localhost:8082/health   # Database
curl -i http://localhost:8083/health   # Radius
```

### Watchdog Configuration: .env vs. YAML

- **watchdog_config.yaml**: Use this file for all per-service health URLs, intervals, and actions. It is version-controlled and should be your primary config for service monitoring.
- **.env**: Use for secrets, notification tokens, and deployment-time overrides. Only set environment variables for values you want to override or keep secret.

**Precedence:**
- If a value is set in `watchdog_config.yaml`, it takes precedence.
- If not set in the config, the watchdog will look for an environment variable (e.g., `WATCHDOG_CHECK_INTERVAL` or `WATCHDOG_CHECK_INTERVAL_APP`).
- If neither is set, the built-in default is used.

**Best Practice:**
- Use `watchdog_config.yaml` for all per-service health checks, intervals, and actions.
- Use `.env` for secrets, notification tokens, and any value you want to override at deployment time without editing the config file.
- Do not duplicate values unless you want override behavior.
